# responsive_dashboard_backup

This repo is backup of a responsive dashboard I created 2 years ago. The whole design of this dashboard is largely copied from a common, free template you can easily find online, but all the html, Javascript and CSS codes were **rewritten**(totally different from original template) by me without using any tools like grunt, LESS. Yes, it is less productive but good to renew and polish frontend skills.
